  abstract = {Motivation: With the continued improvement of requisite mass spectrometers and UHPLC systems, Hydrogen/Deuterium eXchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) workflows are rapidly evolving towards the investigation of more challenging biological systems, including large protein complexes and membrane proteins. The analysis of such extensive systems results in very large HDX-MS datasets for which specific analysis tools are required to speed up data validation and interpretation., Results: We introduce a web application and a new R-package named `MEMHDX' to help users analyze, validate and visualize large HDX-MS datasets. MEMHDX is composed of two elements. A statistical tool aids in the validation of the results by applying a mixed-effects model for each peptide, in each experimental condition, and at each time point, taking into account the time dependency of the HDX reaction and number of independent replicates. Two adjusted P-values are generated per peptide, one for the `Change in dynamics' and one for the `Magnitude of {$\Delta$}D', and are used to classify the data by means of a `Logit' representation. A user-friendly interface developed with Shiny by RStudio facilitates the use of the package. This interactive tool allows the user to easily and rapidly validate, visualize and compare the relative deuterium incorporation on the amino acid sequence and 3D structure, providing both spatial and temporal information., Availability and Implementation: MEMHDX is freely available as a web tool at the project home page http://memhdx.c3bi.pasteur.fr, Contact:

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based peptide amide deuterium exchange techniques have proven to be increasingly powerful tools with which protein structure and function can be studied, and are unparalleled in their ability to probe sub-molecular protein dynamics. Despite this promise, the methodology has remained labor-intensive and time consuming, with substantial limitations in comprehensiveness (the extent to which target protein sequence is covered with measurable peptide fragments) and resolution (the degree to which exchange measurements can be ascribed to particular amides). I have developed and integrated a number of improvements to these methodologies into an automated high throughput, high resolution system termed Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (DXMS). With DXMS, complete sequence coverage and single-amide (amino acid) resolution are now rapidly accomplished. DXMS is designed to work well with large proteins and when only small amounts of material are available for study. Studies can be performed upon a receptor-ligand pair as they exist on or within a living cell (in vivo) without prior purification, allowing effective in situ study of integral membrane protein receptors. We have ambitious initiatives underway to make DXMS widely available both for basic academic research studies and commercial drug discovery efforts. In this paper I present an overview of DXMS technology and highlight some of the benefits it will provide in drug discovery and basic proteomics research.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) has become a key technique for monitoring structural and dynamic aspects of proteins in solution. This approach relies on the fact that exposure of a protein to D(2)O induces rapid amide H \textrightarrow D exchange in disordered regions that lack stable hydrogen-bonding. Tightly folded elements are much more protected from HDX, resulting in slow isotope exchange that is mediated by the structural dynamics ("breathing motions") of the protein. MS-based peptide mapping is a well established technique for measuring the mass shifts of individual protein segments. This tutorial review briefly discusses basic fundamentals of HDX/MS, before highlighting a number of recent developments and applications. Gas phase fragmentation strategies represent a promising alternative to the traditional proteolysis-based approach, but experimentalists have to be aware of scrambling phenomena that can be encountered under certain conditions. Electron-based dissociation methods provide a solution to this problem. We also discuss recent advances that facilitate the applicability of HDX/MS to membrane proteins, and to the characterization of short-lived protein folding intermediates. It is hoped that this review will provide a starting point for novices, as well as a useful reference for practitioners, who require an overview of some recent trends in HDX/MS.},

  abstract = {Proteins are dynamic molecules that exhibit conformational flexibility to function properly. Well-known examples of this are allosteric regulation of protein activity and ligand-induced conformational changes in protein receptors. Detailed knowledge of the conformational properties of proteins is therefore pertinent to both basic and applied research, including drug development, since the majority of drugs target protein receptors and a growing number of drugs introduced to the market are therapeutic peptides or proteins. X-ray crystallography provides a static picture at atomic resolution of the lowest-energy structure of the native ensemble. There is a growing need for sensitive analytical tools to explore all of the significant molecular structures in the conformational landscape of proteins. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange monitored by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) has recently emerged as a powerful method for characterizing protein conformational dynamics. The basis of this method is the fact that backbone amides in stable hydrogen-bonded structures (e.g., {$\alpha$}-helices and {$\beta$}-sheets) are protected against exchange with the aqueous solvent. All protein structures are dynamic, however, and eventually all of the protecting hydrogen bonds will transiently break as the protein--according to thermodynamic principles--cycles through partially unfolded states that correspond to excited free energy levels. As a result, all of the backbone amides will eventually become temporarily solvent-exposed and exchange-competent over time. Consequently, a folded protein in D2O will gradually incorporate deuterium into its backbone amides, and the kinetics of the process can be readily monitored by mass spectrometry. The deuterium uptake kinetics for the intact protein (global exchange kinetics) represents the sum of the exchange kinetics for the individual backbone amides. Local exchange kinetics is typically achieved by using pepsin digestion under quench conditions (i.e., under cold acidic conditions where the amide hydrogen exchange rate is slowed by many orders of magnitude). The ability to localize the individual deuterated residues (the spatial resolution) is determined by the size (typically {$\sim$}7-15 residues) and the number of peptic peptides. These peptides provide a relatively coarse-grained picture of the protein dynamics. A fundamental understanding of the relationship between protein function/dysfunction and conformational dynamics requires in many cases higher resolution and ultimately single-residue resolution. In this Account, we summarize our efforts to achieve single-residue deuterium levels in proteins by electron-based or laser-induced gas-phase fragmentation methods. A crucial analytical requirement for this approach is that the pattern of deuterium labeling from solution is retained in the gas-phase fragment ions. It is therefore essential to control and minimize any occurrence of gas-phase randomization of the solution deuterium label (H/D scrambling) during the MS experiment. For this purpose, we have developed model peptide probes to accurately measure the onset and extent of H/D scrambling. Our analytical procedures to control the occurrence of H/D scrambling are detailed along with the physical parameters that induce it during MS analysis. In light of the growing use of gas-phase dissociation experiments to measure the HDX of proteins in order to obtain a detailed characterization and understanding of the dynamic conformations and interactions of proteins at the molecular level, we discuss the perspectives and challenges of future high-resolution HDX-MS methodology.},

For example, HDX has been used to determine a novel mechanism of ligand activation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-{$\gamma$}, perform detailed analyses of binding modes of ligands within the ligand-binding pocket of two estrogen receptor isoforms, providing insight into selectivity, and helped classify different types of estrogen receptor-{$\alpha$} ligands by correlating their pharmacology with the way they interact with the receptor based solely on hierarchical clustering of receptor HDX signatures. Beyond small-molecule-receptor interactions, this technique has also been applied to study protein-protein complexes, such as mapping antibody-antigen interactions.

  shorttitle = {{{HDX}}-{{Analyzer}}},
  abstract = {Background
HDX mass spectrometry is a powerful platform to probe protein structure dynamics during ligand binding, protein folding, enzyme catalysis, and such. HDX mass spectrometry analysis derives the protein structure dynamics based on the mass increase of a protein of which the backbone protons exchanged with solvent deuterium. Coupled with enzyme digestion and MS/MS analysis, HDX mass spectrometry can be used to study the regional dynamics of protein based on the m/z value or percentage of deuterium incorporation for the digested peptides in the HDX experiments. Various software packages have been developed to analyze HDX mass spectrometry data. Despite the progresses, proper and explicit statistical treatment is still lacking in most of the current HDX mass spectrometry software. In order to address this issue, we have developed the HDXanalyzer for the statistical analysis of HDX mass spectrometry data using R, Python, and RPY2.

Implementation and results
HDXanalyzer package contains three major modules, the data processing module, the statistical analysis module, and the user interface. RPY2 is employed to enable the connection of these three components, where the data processing module is implemented using Python and the statistical analysis module is implemented with R. RPY2 creates a low-level interface for R and allows the effective integration of statistical module for data processing. The data processing module generates the centroid for the peptides in form of m/z value, and the differences of centroids between the peptides derived from apo and ligand-bound protein allow us to evaluate whether the regions have significant changes in structure dynamics or not. Another option of the software is to calculate the deuterium incorporation rate for the comparison. The two types of statistical analyses are Paired Student's t-test and the linear combination of the intercept for multiple regression and ANCOVA model. The user interface is implemented with wxpython to facilitate the data visualization in graphs and the statistical analysis output presentation. In order to evaluate the software, a previously published xylanase HDX mass spectrometry analysis dataset is processed and presented. The results from the different statistical analysis methods are compared and shown to be similar. The statistical analysis results are overlaid with the three dimensional structure of the protein to highlight the regional structure dynamics changes in the xylanase enzyme.

Conclusion
Statistical analysis provides crucial evaluation of whether a protein region is significantly protected or unprotected during the HDX mass spectrometry studies. Although there are several other available software programs to process HDX experimental data, HDXanalyzer is the first software program to offer multiple statistical methods to evaluate the changes in protein structure dynamics based on HDX mass spectrometry analysis. Moreover, the statistical analysis can be carried out for both m/z value and deuterium incorporation rate. In addition, the software package can be used for the data generated from a wide range of mass spectrometry instruments.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Automated selection of signals in protein NMR spectra, known as peak picking, has been studied for over 20\,years, nevertheless existing peak picking methods are still largely deficient. Accurate and precise automated peak picking would accelerate the structure calculation, and analysis of dynamics and interactions of macromolecules. Recent advancement in handling big data, together with an outburst of machine learning techniques, offer an opportunity to tackle the peak picking problem substantially faster than manual picking and on par with human accuracy. In particular, deep learning has proven to systematically achieve human-level performance in various recognition tasks, and thus emerges as an ideal tool to address automated identification of NMR signals.
Results: We have applied a convolutional neural network for visual analysis of multidimensional NMR spectra. A comprehensive test on 31 manually annotated spectra has demonstrated top-tier average precision (AP) of 0.9596, 0.9058 and 0.8271 for backbone, side-chain and NOESY spectra, respectively. Furthermore, a combination of extracted peak lists with automated assignment routine, FLYA, outperformed other methods, including the manual one, and led to correct resonance assignment at the levels of 90.40\%, 89.90\% and 90.20\% for three benchmark proteins.

Both DT and ANN models were developed with 75\% and 80\% of predicting accuracy, respectively. Good agreement between machine learning models and previous experimental as well as computational studies of the same protein validates this approach as an alternative way to analyze protein dynamics simulations and allostery.

  title = {{{HDX}}-{{MS}} Reveals Orthosteric and Allosteric Changes in Apolipoprotein-{{D}} Structural Dynamics upon Binding of Progesterone},
  volume = {28},
  issn = {1469-896X},
  abstract = {Apolipoprotein-D is a glycosylated tetrameric lipocalin that binds and transports small hydrophobic molecules such as progesterone and arachidonic acid. Like other lipocalins, apolipoprotein-D adopts an eight-stranded {$\beta$}-barrel fold stabilized by two intramolecular disulphide bonds, with an adjacent {$\alpha$}-helix. Crystallography studies of recombinant apolipoprotein-D demonstrated no major conformational changes upon progesterone binding. Amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) reports structural changes of proteins in solution by monitoring exchange of amide hydrogens in the protein backbone with deuterium. HDX-MS detects changes in conformation and structural dynamics in response to protein function such as ligand binding that may go undetected in X-ray crystallography, making HDX-MS an invaluable orthogonal technique. Here, we report an HDX-MS protocol for apolipoprotein-D that solved challenges of high protein rigidity and low pepsin cleavage using rigorous quenching conditions and longer deuteration times, yielding 85\% sequence coverage and 50\% deuterium exchange. The relative fractional deuterium exchange of ligand-free apolipoprotein-D revealed apolipoprotein-D to be a highly structured protein. Progesterone binding was detected by significant reduction in deuterium exchange in eight peptides. Stabilization of apolipoprotein-D dynamics can be interpreted as a combined orthosteric effect in the ligand binding pocket and allosteric effect at the N-terminus and C-terminus. Together, our experiments provide insight into apolipoprotein-D structural dynamics and map the effects of progesterone binding that are relayed to distal parts of the protein. The observed stabilization of apolipoprotein-D dynamics upon progesterone binding demonstrates a common behaviour in the lipocalin family and may have implications for interactions of apolipoprotein-D with receptors or lipoprotein particles. Statement: We reveal for the first time how apolipoprotein-D, which is protective in Alzheimer's disease, becomes more ordered when bound to a molecule of steroid hormone. These results significantly extend the understanding of apolipoprotein-D structure from X-ray crystallography studies by incorporating information on how protein motion changes over time. To achieve these results an improved protocol was developed, suitable for proteins similar to apolipoprotein-D, to elucidate how proteins change flexibility when binding to small molecules.},

  abstract = {A key question in mapping dynamics of protein-ligand interactions is to distinguish changes at binding sites from those associated with long range conformational changes upon binding at distal sites. This assumes a greater challenge when considering the interactions of low affinity ligands (dissociation constants, KD, in the {$\mu$}M range or lower). Amide hydrogen deuterium Exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) is a robust method that can provide both structural insights and dynamics information on both high affinity and transient protein-ligand interactions. In this study, an application of HDXMS for probing the dynamics of low affinity ligands to proteins is described using the N-terminal ATPase domain of Hsp90. Comparison of Hsp90 dynamics between high affinity natural inhibitors (KD \textasciitilde{} nM) and fragment compounds reveal that HDXMS is highly sensitive in mapping the interactions of both high and low affinity ligands. HDXMS reports on changes that reflect both orthosteric effects and allosteric changes accompanying binding. Orthosteric sites can be identified by overlaying HDXMS onto structural information of protein-ligand complexes. Regions distal to orthosteric sites indicate long range conformational changes with implications for allostery. HDXMS, thus finds powerful utility as a high throughput method for compound library screening to identify binding sites and describe allostery with important implications for fragment-based ligand discovery (FBLD).},

We answered this question through a novel computational platform integrating Markov state models, machine learning methods, and newly developed community analysis algorithms. Applying this new integrative approach, we provided a quantitative evaluation of the contribution from the covalent bond to the protein global conformational change, and proposed an atomistic allosteric mechanism leading to the discovery of the unexpected importance of A'{$\alpha$}/A{$\beta$} and previously overlooked E{$\alpha$}/F{$\alpha$} loops in the conformational change.

Examples of rational drug design including modulators design targeting on novel druggable targets and protein-protein interaction surface are summarized in this review. Besides, by virtue of the powerful ability in handling high-dimensional data and complex system, deep learning has efficiently promoted the applications of artificial intelligence in drug discovery and design. In this review, deep learning methods tailored to precision drug design are carefully discussed: genetic variants discovery and tumor neoantigen prediction. When a drug molecule is discovered, the development of specific targeted drug delivery system becomes another key aspect of precision drug design.

More recently, differential HDX has been shown to be effective for the characterization of ligand binding. Previously we have described a fully automated HDX system for use as a ligand screening platform. Here we describe and validate the required data analysis workflow to facilitate the use of HDX as a robust approach for ligand screening. Following acquisition of HDX data at a single on-exchange time point (n{$\geq$}3), one way analysis of variance in conjunction with the Tukey multiple comparison procedure is used to establish the significance of any measured difference. Analysis results are graphed with respect to a single peptide, ligand or group of ligands, or displayed as an overview within a heat map. For the heat map display, only {$\Delta\%$}D values with a Tukey-adjusted P-value less than 0.05 are colored. Hierarchical clustering is used to bin compounds with highly similar HDX signatures. The workflow is evaluated with a small dataset showing the ligand binding domain (LDB) of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR{$\gamma$}) screened against 10 functionally selective ligands. More significantly, data for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in complex with 87 ligands are presented. To highlight the robustness and precision of our automated HDX platform we analyzed the data from 4191 replicate HDX measurements acquired over an eight month timeframe. Ninety six percent of these measurements were within 10\% of the mean value. Work has begun to integrate these analysis and graphing components within our HDX software suite.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange (HDX) has been applied, since the 1930s, as an analytical tool to study the structure and dynamics of (small) biomolecules. The popularity of using HDX to study proteins increased drastically in the last two decades due to the successful combination with mass spectrometry (MS). Together with this growth in popularity, several technological advances have been made, such as improved quenching and fragmentation. As a consequence of these experimental improvements and the increased use of protein-HDXMS, large amounts of complex data are generated, which require appropriate analysis. Computational analysis of HDXMS requires several steps. A typical workflow for proteins consists of identification of (non-)deuterated peptides or fragments of the protein under study (local analysis), or identification of the deuterated protein as a whole (global analysis); determination of the deuteration level; estimation of the protection extent or exchange rates of the labile backbone amide hydrogen atoms; and a statistically sound interpretation of the estimated protection extent or exchange rates. Several algorithms, specifically designed for HDX analysis, have been proposed. They range from procedures that focus on one specific step in the analysis of HDX data to complete HDX workflow analysis tools.

Mass Spectrom. 2011: 10.1007/s13361-011-0235-4). This paper describes a computer program called ExMS that furthers this advance by making it possible to efficiently process crowded mass spectra and definitively identify and characterize these many peptide fragments. ExMS automatically scans through high resolution MS data to find the individual isotopic peaks and isotopic envelopes of a list of peptides previously identified by MS/MS. It performs a number of tests to ensure correct identification in spite of peptide overlap in both chromatographic and mass spectrometric dimensions and possible multi-modal envelopes due to static or dynamic structural heterogeneity or HX EX1 behavior. The program can automatically process data from many sequential HX time points with no operator intervention at the rate of \textasciitilde{}2 sec per peptide per HX time point using desktop computer equipment, but it also provides for rapid manual checking and decision when ambiguity exists. Additional subroutines can provide a step by step report of performance at each test along the way and parameter adjustment, deconvolute isotopic envelopes, and plot the time course of single and multi-modal H-D exchange.

  abstract = {Because of unparalleled sensitivity and tolerance to protein size, mass spectrometry (MS) has become a popular method for measuring the solution hydrogen (1H/2H) exchange (HX) of biologically relevant protein states. While incorporated deuterium can be localized to different regions by pepsin proteolysis of the labeled protein, the assignment of deuteriums to individual residues is typically not obtained, thereby limiting a detailed understanding of HX and the dynamics of protein structure. Here we use gas-phase fragmentation of peptic peptides by electron transfer dissociation (ETD) to measure the HX of individual amide linkages in the amyloidogenic protein {$\beta$}2-microglobulin. A comparison of the deuterium levels of 60 individual backbone amides of {$\beta$}2-microglobulin measured by HX-ETD-MS analysis to the corresponding values measured by NMR spectroscopy shows an excellent correlation. The deuterium labeling pattern of {$\beta$}2-microglobulin is retained in the gaseous fragment ions by employing mild declustering conditions for electrospray ionization. A recently developed model peptide is used to arrive at such ion source declustering conditions that prevent the occurrence of intramolecular gas-phase hydrogen (1H/2H) migration (i.e., hydrogen scrambling). This article demonstrates that ETD can be implemented in a mass spectrometric method to monitor the conformational dynamics of proteins in solution at single-residue resolution.},

  title = {Application of an Interpretable Classification Model on {{Early Folding Residues}} during Protein Folding},
  volume = {12},
  issn = {1756-0381},
  abstract = {Background
Machine learning strategies are prominent tools for data analysis. Especially in life sciences, they have become increasingly important to handle the growing datasets collected by the scientific community. Meanwhile, algorithms improve in performance, but also gain complexity, and tend to neglect interpretability and comprehensiveness of the resulting models.

Results
Generalized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ) is a supervised, prototype-based machine learning method and provides comprehensive visualization capabilities not present in other classifiers which allow for a fine-grained interpretation of the data. In contrast to commonly used machine learning strategies, GMLVQ is well-suited for imbalanced classification problems which are frequent in life sciences. We present a Weka plug-in implementing GMLVQ. The feasibility of GMLVQ is demonstrated on a dataset of Early Folding Residues (EFR) that have been shown to initiate and guide the protein folding process. Using 27 features, an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 76.6\% was achieved which is comparable to other state-of-the-art classifiers. The obtained model is accessible at https://biosciences.hs-mittweida.de/efpred/.

Conclusions
The application on EFR prediction demonstrates how an easy interpretation of classification models can promote the comprehension of biological mechanisms. The results shed light on the special features of EFR which were reported as most influential for the classification: EFR are embedded in ordered secondary structure elements and they participate in networks of hydrophobic residues. Visualization capabilities of GMLVQ are presented as we demonstrate how to interpret the results.

  abstract = {Application of typical HDX methods to examine intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP), proteins that are natively unstructured and highly dynamic at physiological pH, is limited due to the rapid exchange of unprotected amide hydrogens with solvent. The exchange rates of these fast exchanging amides are usually faster than the shortest time scale (10s) employed in typical automated HDX-MS experiments. Considering the functional importance of IDPs and their association with many diseases, it is valuable to develop methods that allow the study of solution dynamics of these proteins as well as the ability to probe the interaction of IDPs with their wide range of binding partners. Here, we report the application of time window expansion to the millisecond range by altering the on-exchange pH of the HDX experiment to study a well characterized IDP; the activation domain of the nuclear receptor coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1{$\alpha$}). This method enabled mapping the regions of PGC-1{$\alpha$} that are stabilized upon binding the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR{$\gamma$}). We further demonstrate the method's applicability to other binding partners of the IDP PGC-1{$\alpha$} and pave the way for characterizing many other biologically important ID proteins.},

  abstract = {Protein hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) followed by protease digestion and mass spectrometric (MS) analysis is accepted as a standard method for studying protein conformation and conformational dynamics. In this article, an improved HDX MS platform with fully automated data processing is described. The platform significantly reduces systematic and random errors in the measurement by introducing two types of corrections in HDX data analysis. First, a mixture of short peptides with fast HDX rates is introduced as internal standards to adjust the variations in the extent of back exchange from run to run. Second, a designed unique peptide (PPPI) with slow intrinsic HDX rate is employed as another internal standard to reflect the possible differences in protein intrinsic HDX rates when protein conformations at different solution conditions are compared. HDX data processing is achieved with a comprehensive HDX model to simulate the deuterium labeling and back exchange process. The HDX model is implemented into the in-house developed software MassAnalyzer and enables fully unattended analysis of the entire protein HDX MS data set starting from ion detection and peptide identification to final processed HDX output, typically within 1 day. The final output of the automated data processing is a set (or the average) of the most possible protection factors for each backbone amide hydrogen. The utility of the HDX MS platform is demonstrated by exploring the conformational transition of a monoclonal antibody by increasing concentrations of guanidine.},

  abstract = {The function, efficacy, and safety of protein biopharmaceuticals are tied to their three-dimensional structure. The analysis and verification of this higher-order structure are critical in demonstrating manufacturing consistency and in establishing the absence of structural changes in response to changes in production. It is, therefore, essential to have reliable, high-resolution and high sensitivity biophysical tools capable of interrogating protein structure and conformation. Here, we demonstrate the use of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (H/DX-MS) in biopharmaceutical comparability studies. H/DX-MS measurements can be conducted with good precision, consume only picomoles of protein, interrogate nearly the entire molecule with peptide level resolution, and can be completed in a few days. Structural comparability or lack of comparability was monitored for different preparations of interferon-{$\beta$}-1a. We present specific graphical formats for the display of H/DX-MS data that aid in rapidly making both the qualitative (visual) and quantitative assessment of comparability. H/DX-MS is capable of making significant contributions in biopharmaceutical characterization by providing more informative and confident comparability assessments of protein higher order structure than are currently available within the biopharmaceutical industry.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) coupled with mass spectrometry (HDXMS) is a rapid and effective method for localizing and determining protein stability and dynamics. Localization is routinely limited to a peptide resolution of 5 to 20 amino acid residues. HDXMS data can contain information beyond that needed for defining protein stability at single amide resolution. Here we present a method for extracting this information from an HDX dataset to generate a HDXMS protein stability fingerprint. High resolution (HR)-HDXMS was applied to the analysis of a model protein of a spectrin tandem repeat that exemplified an intuitive stability profile based on the linkage of two triple helical repeats connected by a helical linker. The fingerprint recapitulated expected stability maximums and minimums with interesting structural features that corroborate proposed mechanisms of spectrin flexibility and elasticity. HR-HDXMS provides the unprecedented ability to accurately assess protein stability at the resolution of a single amino acid. The determination of HDX stability fingerprints may be broadly applicable in many applications for understanding protein structure and function as well as protein ligand interactions.},
